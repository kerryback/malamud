### Target Audience

Graduate students and faculty in finance, statistics, computer science, and economics and related disciplines 

### Sponsors

- Creative Ventures Fund, Office of Research
- Jones Graduate School of Business
- Center for Computational Finance & Economic Systems
- Department of Computer Science
- Department of Economics

### Learning Outcomes

- **Modeling with High-Dimensional Predictors**<br>Understand modern methods for large-scale data and factor models in finance.
- **Overfitting and Complexity**<br>Recognize the role of over-parameterized models in predictive performance, portfolio choice, and decision making.
- **Neural Networks**<br>Interpret deep vs. shallow learning architectures and their application to financial data. 
- **Deep Learning and Feature Learning**
- **Factor Models**<br>Construct and analyze high-dimensional factor models for the cross-section of returns.
- **Equilibrium**<br>Assess how complexity corrections change asset pricing fundamentals and how complexity leads to tractable equilibria with non-linear parameter learning.
